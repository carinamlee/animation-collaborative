The lectures and critiques I received from my instructor made very significant impacts in improved execution/workflow and, most importantly, coming up with stronger ideas for shots. Week to week I had many "aha!" moments and could see the strides I was making. I don't know where I'd be in my career without my instructor and attending AnimC. I will always be grateful!</i></p>

Generosity is the name of the game. I had the wonderful opportunity to learn from Michal Makarewicz and Victor Navone, two humble and wonderful animators who really helped me improve my animation skills and motivated me to always keep learning. They are also well priced for the content you get. When I was there, I would arrive early and soak in the awesome lecture library they have available. I owe the staff so much for the priceless knowledge they gave me. Even now, though I'm lucky to be employed. I'm setting aside money to go back and learn as much as I can from them!
